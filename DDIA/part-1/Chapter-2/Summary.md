----
1. Relational Model: Data is organized into _relations_ (called _tables_ in SQL), where each relation is an unordered collection of _tuples_ (_rows_ in SQL).
2. _NoSQL_  is considered as _Not Only SQL_ 
3. Reasons for NoSQL adoption
	1. A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, including very large datasets or very high write throughput
	2.  A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial database products.
	3. Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model
	4. Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more dynamic and expressive data model
