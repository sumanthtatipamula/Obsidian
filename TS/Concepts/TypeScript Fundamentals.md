- Why typescript ?
	- It has the potential to move some kinds of errors from runtime to compile time
		- Values that are potentially absent
		- Incomplete refactoring
		- breakage around internal code contracts
	- It serves as the foundation for a great code authoring experience
		- Ex: In-editor autocomplete
